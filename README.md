# JavaScript: Password Generator



## Why did I create this Password Generator ?

This project was designed as a homework assignment for our UWA bootcamp 

This is my first coding project performed with Javascript (as well as HTML and CSS provided) - It has the function to generate a random password after getting instruction from the user as to the length of the password - between 8 and 128 characters - and choice of character types he/she would like to include. They need to choose at least one character type.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

To use the Password Generator, you need to click on the red button to start the process.
